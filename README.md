Kotlin Journey: Command-Line Note-Taking AppThis repository documents my learning progress in the Kotlin programming language by building a practical command-line application.Project Concept: Simple Note TakerThe goal is to create a simple but functional note-taking application that runs in the terminal. Users will be able to add, view, and delete notes. This project is an excellent way to apply fundamental Kotlin concepts in a real-world scenario.Core Learning ObjectivesVariables & Data Types: Storing note content and IDs.Control Flow: Using when, if/else, and loops to manage user commands.Collections: Using MutableList or ArrayList to hold the notes in memory.Functions: Organizing code into reusable blocks for adding, viewing, and deleting notes.User Input: Reading commands and note text from the console.Data Classes: Creating a simple Note class to structure the data.Phase 1: The Basics (Your Starting Point)This is the first version you can build. It covers the absolute essentials.Features:Welcome Message: Display a welcome message and a list of available commands when the app starts.Add a Note: A command to add a new note. The app will prompt the user to enter their text.View All Notes: A command to display all the notes that have been added, perhaps with an index number.Exit: A command to gracefully exit the application.Example Note Data Class:data class Note(val id: Int, val content: String)
Example Usage Flow:Welcome to your Note-Taking App!
Commands: :add, :view, :exit

> :add
Enter your note: Learn Kotlin data classes
Note added!

> :add
Enter your note: Build the first version of my app
Note added!

> :view
1. Learn Kotlin data classes
2. Build the first version of my app

> :exit
Goodbye!
Future Phases: Expanding Your SkillsAs you learn more Kotlin, you can come back to this project and add more features. This shows your growth over time.Potential Enhancements:Phase 2: Improved FunctionalityDelete a Note: Add a :delete command that removes a note by its ID.Search Notes: Implement a :search command to find notes containing a specific keyword.Error Handling: What happens if a user tries to delete a note that doesn't exist? Add checks and user-friendly error messages.Phase 3: Data PersistenceFile I/O: Learn how to save your notes to a file (notes.txt or notes.json) when the app closes and load them back when it starts. This is a great way to learn about Kotlin's file handling libraries.Phase 4: Advanced ConceptsObject-Oriented Programming (OOP): Refactor your code into more classes. Maybe a NoteService class that handles all the logic for managing notes.GUI: Take a big leap and build a simple graphical user interface using a framework like Jetpack Compose for Desktop. This will be a significant step in your learning journey!This project provides a clear path from beginner to more advanced topics. Good luck with your Kotlin learning, and have fun building your app!
